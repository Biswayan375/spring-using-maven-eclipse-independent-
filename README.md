# spring-using-maven-eclipse-independent-
This repo has a spring starter project with nothing very interesting in it showing how we can spin up a spring application using maven using just a notepad and terminal.

Generally when we try to learn maven most of the tutorials available in the web are on eclipse or on some other IDE. In my case I had run into some problem running maven
in eclipse and that feels like learning how to use an IDE like eclipse instead of the actual technology. So I searched hard in the web and found some really useful resources on how to spin up a maven application, be it a spring one because at the end of the day spring utilizes maven. I am not explaining in my words again because they have done pretty well.
